                    <p>I grew up mostly in Hawaii, but have spent many years in various locations including South Korea
                        and Alaska. I started to pick up coding back in high school when Myspace was a rampant thing. I
                        assisted my friends and even my big sister in properly setting up their pages and made my own
                        styles.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If it's not coding I'm usually spending my time with family and friends, including my four legged "son" as I call him.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I took up the main portion of the javascript and api calls for this site.

                    <p>I was born and raised in Indian Trail, North Carolina. I moved a lot when I was younger. I used to live in Raleigh and Colorado. I don't really have any prior knowledge on coding except a class in high school and the prework. I do however find it really enjoyable and challenging.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>What I enjoy outside of coding is hanging out with friends and playing video games.</p>

                    <p>I helped with the HTML and CSS.
